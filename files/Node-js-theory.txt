A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking. In addition, libraries in Node.js are generally written using non-blocking paradigms. Accordingly, blocking behavior is the exception rather than the norm in Node.js.
